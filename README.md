# Inventory Management Console App
Welcome! This is an Inventory Management Application I built for my first semester at **Code Louisville** - Spring '22. The app is designed to assist with a generic music store's inventory. Each item added to the inventory is an iteration of the "Equipment" class. It is very loosely based on an application I used at a former place of employment. The github project title "POS.ConsoleApp" because I intend to add future features that one would find in a point of sale app.
## Features
The four features I applied the following... 

 - Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can
   repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit
   the program 
 - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several
   values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program 
 - Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that
   data in your application
 - Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
## Notes
My app requires that the inventory.csv file be located here: *POS.ConsoleApp\POS.ConsoleApp\POS.ConsoleApp\Docs\inventory.csv*
In the event that this file is not located here, I have included a copy of this inventory in the parent folder by the same name. Please create a Docs folder and place the file inside - following the path listed above. This will not likely be necessary, as I have tested it on multiple computers with no issues.
